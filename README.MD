### Sensor suite supported
- 6-axis IMU + Velodyne/Ouster/Robosense LiDAR (Livox LiDAR can be also supported if the data of which is tansformed to the format of velodyne's, i.e., PointXYZRT.)
---
### Prerequisites
- Install depends follow the instructions of ["cartographer"](https://google-cartographer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and ["cartographer_ros"](https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compilation.html) respectively. 
- Build [OpenCV 3.3.1](https://opencv.org/releases/page/2/) (other version may work fine if it includes implementation of SURF keypoint detector) from source with "opencv_contrib"
- [GTSAM 4.0.2](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/tree/4.0.2)
---
### Build
- Clone this repository in your ROS workspace

- Set CMake variable "OpenCV_DIR" in the root [CMakeLists.txt](src/cartographer/CMakeLists.txt) of "cartographer". 

- Return to the root folder of your ROS workspace (which has the same directory as this "README" file) and run:

      catkin_make_isolated

### Run an online demo
#### TONGJI Dataset
- Some demo sequences can be downloaded via: 

  - TONGJI dataset: [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/12Y6CErygofwPf9f8FrNLqA), pwd: hfrl

- ```roslaunch dlio demo_dlio_tongji.launch bag_filename:=BAG_FILE_PATH```
  where BAG_FILE_PATH is the full path of the downloaded bag file in your device

- Some results on the self-collected TONGJI dataset.

#### NTU-VIRAL

- The dataset is available online at [NTU-VIRAL](https://ntu-aris.github.io/ntu_viral_dataset/)

-     ```roslaunch dlio demo_dlio_viral.launch bag_filename:=BAG_FILE_PATH```
  where BAG_FILE_PATH is the full path of the downloaded bag file in your device
  
-     Results on VIRAL

#### KAIST-Complex Urban Dataset
- The dataset is available online at [KAIST](https://irap.kaist.ac.kr/dataset/)

- Play KAIST bag follow the instruction: [file_player](https://irap.kaist.ac.kr/dataset/development.html)

- ```roslaunch dlio demo_dlio_kaist.launch```

- Results on KAIST "Urban-09" and "Urban-10"

      <img src="img/kaist.png">  
  </div>
#### Your own data
- Write a urdf file of your device and save it to folder ['urdf'](src/dlio/urdf)
- Write a configuration file of your data and save it to ['config'](src/dlio/config)
- Write a launch file of your data and save it to ['launch'](src/dlio/launch)
- Run your bag as above examples
---
### Run offline and view mapping result
#### Launch dlio offline
    roslaunch dlio dlio_offline_tongji bag_filenames:=BAG_FILE_PATH
#### View mapping result
    roslaunch dlio dlio_map_viewer_rectified urdf_filename:=tongji pose_graph_pb_filename:=PG_FILENAME range_data_pb_filename:=RD_FILENAME rate:=100
  where PG_FILENAME and RD_FILENAME are binary pbstream files saved to disk when launch the offline script above.
